A second poll without --takeover fails with LISTENER_ACTIVE instead of silently returning waiting.\n\nThis command long-polls indefinitely for queued user prompts. It stays silent while it waits - that is normal, never kill it. Browser-detected layout issues do NOT return this poll: they are filed passively in the user's Layout issues inbox and arrive as an ordinary tag "layout-warnings" prompt only after the user selects them and queues the fixes. Warning lifecycle: an issue stays unresolved and counted while queued, becomes recurring if a newer artifact revision still shows it, and is resolved only after a newer artifact load plus a complete diagnostic pass at the same viewport no longer detects it. A failed or incomplete pass preserves it as unverified rather than clearing it. The only response that arrives without user action is artifact_failures - a fatal failure that made the review surface itself unusable. Do not pass --timeout-ms during normal agent use; it is for tests and debugging only.

    export: `Usage: lavish-axi export <html-file> [--out <path>]\n\nWrite a portable copy of an artifact: one HTML file with its LOCAL assets inlined (relative-path stylesheets, scripts, images, and fonts become inline <style>/<script> blocks and data URIs). Remote CDN/font references (https URLs) are left as links for the browser to load, so the file needs network to render those. Lavish makes no outbound requests - it only reads local files, confined to the artifact's directory. Defaults to writing <name>.export.html next to the source; pass --out to choose a path. The Lavish annotation SDK is never included in an export.\n`,
    share: `Usage:\n  lavish-axi share <html-file> [--private | --password <pw>] [--token <t>]\n  lavish-axi share <html-file> --site <site_id> --update-key <key> [--private | --password <pw>]\n  lavish-axi share --unpublish --site <site_id> --update-key <key>\n\nPublish the artifact on ht-ml.app (https://ht-ml.app), a third-party hosting service not part of Lavish, and print a visitable URL. Shares are PUBLIC by default: anyone with the link can open the page, and it may be indexed or scraped. Pass --private to publish a PRIVATE page behind a generated password, returned once in the output - give it to the user with the URL and tell them it is a shared secret. Pass --password <pw> instead when the user chose the password; it is never echoed back. Builds the same local-inlined HTML as 'export' (local assets inlined; remote CDN/font URLs left as links and are not blocked by CSP on ht-ml.app, but still load over the viewer's network), then POSTs it to ht-ml.app's /v1 API. Creating a site needs no account or API key. The response includes the url plus a secret update_key (shown once) for changing the page later.\n\n--site <site_id> with --update-key <key> republishes an existing page in place: same URL, new HTML. On a republish the password is left alone unless you pass --private (rotate to a new generated one) or --password <pw> (set one). There is no way to make a private page public again: ht-ml.app accepts a request to clear a password and silently ignores it, so Lavish does not offer one rather than reporting a page as public while it is still gated. Locking a page that was PUBLIC is also not instant at ht-ml.app's CDN: it was observed still answering uncredentialed requests for minutes after the password was set, so do not tell the user a newly gated page is unreachable right away (a page that was already private has no such cached copy).\n\n--unpublish takes the same credentials and no file. ht-ml.app has NO delete endpoint, so this replaces the page with a short placeholder and locks it behind a random password that is immediately discarded; the URL still resolves and the host still holds what was published. Say that to the user rather than calling it deleted. The update_key still works, so republishing with --private brings the page back behind a new password.\n\nA value flag given an empty or whitespace-only value is REFUSED rather than acted on: an unquoted shell variable that is unset makes \`--password $PW\` an empty password, which the host treats as none and would publish a PUBLIC page while you believed it was gated. Quote the value, or pass --private to have Lavish generate one.\n\nSet LAVISH_AXI_HTML_APP_TOKEN (or pass --token) to attach an optional bearer token when CREATING a page; it is never required. A republish (--site/--update-key) or --unpublish rejects --token, because the update_key is what the Authorization header carries there. The annotation SDK is never included.\n`,

    server: `Usage: lavish-axi server [--port 4387] [--verbose] [--also-listen <host>...]\n\nRun the local Lavish Editor server. Pass --verbose (or set LAVISH_AXI_DEBUG=1) to log session and watcher events to stderr. Detached server output is appended to ~/.lavish-axi/server.log, or LAVISH_AXI_STATE_DIR/server.log when set, for startup and crash diagnostics.\n\nBy default Lavish binds to 127.0.0.1 and, when Tailscale is running, this machine's Tailscale IPv4. Any explicit LAVISH_AXI_HOST overrides automatic Tailscale binding; wildcard values such as 0.0.0.0 or :: are restricted to loopback. An explicit non-wildcard LAVISH_AXI_HOST sets the bind address, and the server also listens on 127.0.0.1 so every local CLI finds it; --also-listen adds further concrete addresses (the CLI passes it when it replaces a server, to keep every address the old one served). An address that cannot be bound is retried in the background and reported as network_warning. Binding beyond loopback exposes an unauthenticated server that can read and serve arbitrary local files to anything that can reach it, so only do so on a trusted network. With automatic binding enabled, a successfully bound Tailscale listener uses its MagicDNS name in generated session links; otherwise LAVISH_AXI_LINK_HOST can set the link hostname. See README's Allowed hosts section for Host allowlisting and LAVISH_AXI_ALLOWED_HOSTS. LAVISH_AXI_NO_OPEN=1 (or --no-open) suppresses the local browser launch.\n`,
